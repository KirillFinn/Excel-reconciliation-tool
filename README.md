# Excel-reconciliation-tool
This is a tool for comparing two Excel tables with lists of transactions and for reconciling them. The tool works well for Excel files not exceeding 10Mb in size.
For larger files, they should be processed on the server side because of limitations in web browsers.

Updated v1.2: Added support for .xlsb files
